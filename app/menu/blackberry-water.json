    "Blackberry Hint is by far my favorite flavor. I have tried several of them and it is exactly what you expect and hope it would be!",
    "Blackberry Hint Water is how I get my water intake to the max for the day. At first I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about the Blackberry flavor, but it's not my favorite. It's just the right touch of flavor to delight my taste buds.",
    "I love blackberries and this water is perfect for a diabetic--no sugar or artificial sweetners."
