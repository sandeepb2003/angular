    "Not bad, not super filling",
    "Overall good . I found the salad was a bit wilted or softened by the other hot food in the container. Maybe pack the salad separately next time , it does not look very good.",
    "I almost never give 5 stars to anything. I could eat this dish every day forever and be thrilled. Not a ton of meat, but the veggies, pickles, and rice work together perfectly, and the chicken is moist and nicely cooked."
